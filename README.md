# My local config

This repository stores my local config for [git](https://git-scm.com/docs), [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) and [zshrc](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/zsh_toc.html).

It should be cloned in  `~`.

Repositories for development are expected to lie in your local `~/dev` directory.
